    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
\nI love fish.
\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\nI like eating fish, too.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.</string>
