    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.\n
        I love fish.\n
        The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river.\n
        Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.\n
        I like eating fish, too.\n
        And sometimes I even go fishing.\n
        And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.\n
        I\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.\n
        You should ask someone else about fishing, though.
